## numberGuesser
numberGuesser project 1 mod 1 Turing School of Software and Design

### Project Goals
Create a guess the number.  Users input a range and the game generates a random number.  If the user guesses the number,
the range automatically increases by 20.

### Biggest Challenges while building
Button states.  Toggling instruction text

### Additional features that could be added to improve usablility
1. Be able to toggle instructions closed
2. Fix button states so that when text field is cleared, buttons are disabled
3. Remain on the same target value until user guesses number, tally the number of tries and give feed back to user
